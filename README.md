# Ophthalmic v0.0.1

#### A free and open source MIDI visualizer with easy of use, performance, and graphics in mind.

## Why?
As an artist and programmer who passionately supports open source, I release all of my music using programs such as [PianoFromAbove](https://pfa.mbms.me) and [SeeMusic](https://www.visualmusicdesign.com/seemusic). This allows me to share how I create music, from chord structures to how I write leads, and enables anyone interested to learn my songs, or see how I created something they enjoyed.

#### No software currently meets my needs:
  - Performs well for those without great hardware
  - Is visually appealing while also being informative
  - Is easy to use
  - Is open source/cross-platform

With this in mind, I decided to make my own, but just hardcoding or using a well known graphics engine was too easy, so this is also created with my own graphics engine, [DAGGer](https://github.com/DAGGer).

## Current status/roadmap
  - [ ] Profit (jk it's FOSS)
  - [ ] Understand that no projects are ever finished
  - [ ] Make it more customizable
  - [ ] Quality of life features
  - [ ] Enable exporting renders for slow hardware
  - [ ] Make it easy to record
  - [ ] User preferences/editing for graphics
  - [ ] Optionally, make it pretty
  - [ ] Initial Release
  - [ ] Make human interpretable interface
  - [ ] Make it stable/work well
  - [ ] User preferences (keyboard size)
  - [ ] File explorer
  - [ ] Read MIDI files
  - [ ] Make the piano and notes work together
  - [ ] Show piano on screen
  - [X] Show notes on the screen
  - [X] Get working on DAGGer

This will be a long journey, but I hope to create the best product on the market. I hope you'll join me for the ride :)

## Installation
Use Visual Studio and compile from source (for now)

## Compile from source
*Currently, only Windows is supported*

  - Download source code or git clone
  - Launch Windows-Setup.bat
    - Wait for the DAGGer to download and initialize (hopefully just the .lib in the future)
    - Wait for premake to generate the VS Solution
  - Launch Ophthalmic.sln
  - Pray that it works
  - Enjoy!
