My FOSS program that serves as an alternative to some of the best "Synthesia" alternatives I have previously used:
Synthesia, PianoFromAbove, and SeeMusic.

My goal for this project is to create my own code for my purposes of Synthesia.
Performance:  PianoFromAbove
Graphics:     SeeMusic
Ease-of-use:  Synthesia

This will be a long journey, but I hope to provide a free and easy-to-use alternative that
preforms well, but will have options for better graphics, and is easy to use for those less technologically-inclinded,
and has plenty of room for specific modification for those more inclined.
I hope to see you at the destination!
